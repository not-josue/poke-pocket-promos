# Notes

These are a couple of notes taken while building the project.

## Dynamic Metadata

React 19 came with an update to easily customize metadata for each page, so React Helmet Async was not needed.

## Navigation

Had to give up on some pages having a fixed Navigation & others not. Becomes complicated as Scoping doesn't work like Astro. Settle for a non-fixed Navigation across the website.
